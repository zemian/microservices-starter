What is the MicroProfile?

Developers have a tremendous amount of Java EE and general Enterprise Java knowledge and skill that they want to leverage as they evaluate the adoption of a cloud-native architecture. The MicroProfile is a baseline platform definition that optimizes Enterprise Java for a microservices architecture and delivers application portability across multiple MicroProfile runtimes. The initially planned baseline is JAX-RS + CDI + JSON-P, with the intent of community having an active role in the MicroProfile definition and roadmap.
